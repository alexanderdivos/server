        <b>&#8734; Unlimited Possibilities &#8734;</b>
		<hr>
		<br>
		Cookie's Realm is proud to call itself the one and only "Official Slimefun Server". 
		If you don't know what Slimefun is, here is a brief explanation of what Slimefun does:<br>
		<br>
		Slimefun is a Plugin which aims to offer you a unique Experience. Tired of the limited possibilities by Minecraft? 
		Slimefun helps out with that! You are able to craft and use tons of new Items including Jetpacks, Magical Wands and
		a lot more!<br>
		With currently more than <b>700</b> new Items added by Slimefun and all of its Addons,
		we can guarantee you that you will have a hard time finding yourself bored!
		
		<br>

        <b>&#127757; Quests, Ruins & Loot &#127757;</b>
		<hr>
		<br>
		Our Plugin QuestWorld is going to make sure you will never get bored!<br>
		You can gain new Items, win Lucky Blocks and even unlock new Cosmetics! 
		But the best part about QuestWorld is that you can team up with other Players to complete 
		Questlines together! Gaming is a Collaboration and this is what we had in mind when 
		putting together all Parts of our Server. 
		But even if none of your friends is around, do not worry! 
		There is still a lot you can do without them and when they come back they are able to 
		claim the Rewards of all Quests you completed in the meantime.<br>
		<br>
		But besides all the preset Paths of your Adventures, you can go ahead and start your
		own Adventure as well! Our World is populated with tons of Ruins, Damaged Buildings and Dungeons
		which you can explore. <br>
		Maybe you will find a strange pair of Diamond Boots with Bane of Athropods II, maybe you will end up 
		finding a legendary Diamond Sword with Sharpness X?<br>
		Everything is possible!
